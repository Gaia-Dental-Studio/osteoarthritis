# Osteoarthritis
This repository consists of the helper code for osteoarthritis (OA) severity grade detection model.


## Osteoarthritis Severity Detection
This model was fine-tuned from ResNet18 with [The Knee Osteoarthritis Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shashwatwork/knee-osteoarthritis-dataset-with-severity/data) using Pytorch in 25 epochs, Adam optimizer, and a learning rate 0.001. The model accuracy obtained during training are 62%.
